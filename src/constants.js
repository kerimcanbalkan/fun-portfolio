  welcome: `Welcome!
I’m Kerimcan Balkan. This is my interactive portfolio - explore, move around, and learn more about me!
In a hurry? Check out the <a href="https://kerimcanbalkan.github.io/boring-portfolio/">boring version</a> instead.`,
  computer: `This is my Computer!
I spend a lot of time coding in JavaScript and TypeScript for both frontend and backend projects. Lately, I’ve been diving into Golang and I’m loving it! I’m mostly self-taught and truly passionate about coding. If you’re curious to see my work, check out my GitHub account: <a href="https://www.github.com/kerimcanbalkan" target="_blank">My Github</a> `,
  tv: `That's my TV.When I’m not coding or stargazing, I’m watching epic anime like Naruto and One Piece. I also watch a lot of YouTube—tech, repair, and even history stuff. My sister says these are the "boring" videos, but hey, I think they’re pretty cool. Someone’s gotta know how to fix things and learn from the past!`,
  sofa: `Yep, this is where I kick back and relax. And, if I’m being honest, it’s also where I sometimes get lost in endless doom scrolling. Hey, we all need a break sometimes, right?`,
  cv: `Oops, I left my Resume on top of the dresser!

  library: `Welcome to my treasure trove of history, Russian novels, and tech wonders. I love diving into these topics in Turkish, English, and Albanian. For me, every book is an adventure and every page a new discovery!`,
  degree: `This is my Astronomy and Space Science Degree!
Yep, I studied the stars! But don't worry, I’m just as skilled at coding here on Earth. Full-stack developer by day, space enthusiast by night. My degree proves I can navigate both the cosmos and the code!`,
  cook: `This is my Kitchen!
Cooking has become a recent hobby of mine. I’m just starting to learn the ropes, so don’t expect any Michelin-star dishes yet! But hey, every great chef starts somewhere, right? `,
  music: `This is my Pickup Player!
I’m a music lover and guitar player, always jamming to everything from Chet Baker’s smooth jazz to the energetic riffs of RHCP. Whether it’s Turkish rock or rap, my playlist has it all. `,
